 # LEARNING javaScript

## **Introduction to JavaScript:**

JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but now it is used in many other environments as well.
javascript is used to make webpages alive.It provides manipulation of webpages and interactions in diffrenet ways with a user.

### **Executing JavaScript:**

Different browsers use different engines to execute javascript, like chrome use v8 while firefox uses SpiderMonkey.

### **Why JavaScript:**

javascript provides integration with html and css
It is supported by all browsers
It makes coding simply.

with javascript we can add different interactions on mouse click, pinter movements and key presses.

### **JavaScript is Safer:**

Many browsers restrict js from raeding writting on the disk.
When one page opens another through Javascript they may not be able to acccess each other through the _"Same Access Policy"_, data can only be exchnaged if both pages agree to it.

Js can't receive data from other site and domain .When working on a site, it can only interact with the server.

#### **JavaScript Transpilers:**

Js may not be suitable for all projects and people, since they have different needs. So there are some languages that are transpiled to js.These Langauges include:

##### **1. CoffeeScript:**  
 Introduces Shorter syntax than js, it makes the code clear and more understanable.

##### **2. TypeScript:**      
Introduces strict data typing for more complex development.

##### **3. Dart:**    
Developed by Google, is a stand alone system that runs on non browser envrionment like android apps.

##### **4. Flow:**     
Developed by FaceBook, introduced strict data typing of many types.

##### **5. Brython:**  
Is a Pthyon transpiler into JS, it enables one to write pure python.
